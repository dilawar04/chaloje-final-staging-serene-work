                            <p class="full-text">The strategic value of Gwadar was first recognized in 1954 when it was
                                identified as a suitable site for a deep water port by the United States Geological
                                Survey at the request of Pakistan while the territory was still under Omani rule.
                                <i>Gwadar is strategically located on the western end of Baluchistan coast on the
                                    opposite end of the Gulf of Oman.</i></p>

                            <h4>HISTORY – ‘VICTORIA’ A LADY OF COURAGE</h4>
                            <p class="full-text">Victoria was an Austrian lady who later married Feroz Khan Noon, the
                                seventh prime minister of Pakistan. After her marriage with Mr. Noon, she moved to
                                Pakistan, reverted to Islam and changed her name to Viqar ul Nisa.

                                The Shah of Iran was new to thrown, and the CIA was having Nixon talk to Harold
                                Macmillan to give Gwadar to the Shah of Iran. Victoria saw Americans pushing for Iran
                                over Pakistan and intercepted the lobby head-on. She worked hard in London in 1956 to
                                get the British PM and parliament's approval for Gwadar to be returned to Paki- stan
                                from Omani rule.

                    She also went to Winston Churchill, who upon Victoria’s request also lobbied for ‘Gwadar' to be
                    given to Pakistan. She was popularly known as ‘Victoria’ in the British Circles.

                    Let us also not forget Prince Karim Aga Khan, who paid the entire amount of 3 million dollars in
                    September of 1958 on behalf of Pakistan to buy back Gwadar back from the Sultanate of Oman. </p>

                    In April of 2015, Pakistan and China announced their intention to develop the multi billion dollar
                    China–Pakistan Economic Corridor(CPEC), which in turn forms part of China's ambitious 3 Trillion
                    Dollar ‘One Belt, One Road’ Initiative.

                    <br><br>

                    CPEC is a 3,218 kilometer long route, to be built over next several years, consisting of highways,
                    railways and pipelines. The actual estimated cost of the project is expected to be US$75 billion,
                    out of which in access of US$45 billion was spent to ensure that the corridor becomes operational by
                    2020. The remaining investment is being spent on energy generation and infrastructure development.

                    <br><br>

                    CPEC will not only benefit China and Pakistan but will have a positive impact on Iran, Afghanistan,
                    Central Asian Republic, and the region as whole. The enhancement of geographical linkages having
                    state-of-the-art road, rail and air transportation system with frequent and free exchanges of growth
                    and people to people contact will result in a well connected and integrated region of shared
                    destiny, harmony and development.
